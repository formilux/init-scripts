	* released init-scripts-0.3.35-flx0.1
	* the network script can now set the hostname via DHCP and waits
	  1 second for the link to set up when needed before the DHCP request.
	* the 'daemon' function no longer closes stdin/stdout, but rather
	  redirects them to /dev/null in order to avoid stupid daemons such
	  as cron to pass closed fds to the services they call !
